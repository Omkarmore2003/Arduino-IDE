Electronic Circuit Fault Detection and Data Logging System
Project Overview
This project is designed to monitor and log critical circuit parameters such as voltage, current, and PWM in real-time using a Teensy 4.1 microcontroller. The system captures and records analog data from an electronic circuit and logs it with timestamps onto an SD card in .csv format using the SPI interface. This data can later be used to analyze circuit behavior, investigate faulty components, and identify potential anomalies at various operating conditions.
